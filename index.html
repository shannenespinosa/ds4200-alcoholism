<h2 id="bg">Background</h2>
    <p>
        Alcohol consumption is often editorialized in college life. Sometimes,
        in the glitz and glamor of partying, it's hard to remember the severity
        of alcohol related diseases. The NIH estimates that approximately 30 million
        or 10% of Americans have alcohol addictive disorders. Alcohol can impact
        longevity and the quality of life of those intoxicated and those around them.
        So how does college play into a potentially life long comorbidity?
    </p>
    <p>
        In our initial exploratory research into the surveillance of excessive alcohol use,
        we found reports indicating drastic decreases in life expectancies when
        comparing drinkers to non-drinkers (Fig 1) as well as insight into the
        non-linear relationship of alcohol consumption with all-cause mortality
        rates (Fig 2).

        With this in mind, our project seeks to analyze Alcohol-Related Disease Impacts (ARDIs)
        across the United States by looking into patterns of alcohol based
        deaths based on numerous factors that may suggest a higher prevalence
        of normalization of abusive or binge-drinking culture. We used <span>Pandas</span>,
        <span>GeoPandas</span>, <span>D3</span>, and <span>Altair</span> for our final analyses.
    </p>

<h2 id="ds">Dataset</h2>
    <p>
        We analyzed the dataset from Health.gov on <a href="https://healthdata.gov/dataset/Alcohol-Related-Disease-Impact-ARDI-Application-Al/8i56-u98i/about_data"> Alcohol-Related Disease Impact</a>. It contains 30 columns and 62,505 rows
        of data. The rows are data reports between 2015 and 2019 across
        ages and sexes for deaths attributable to alcohol. It contains
        estimates of alcohol-related disease impacts across the United
        States, noting causes of death and years of potential life lost.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dataset, <span>filtered_alc_mort.csv</span>, documents total
        fatalities in a given combination of state, extent, cause of death,
        age group, gender, etc. For instance, between 2015 and 2019, there
        were 13 deaths documented concerning excessive alcohol use among
        females under 21 leading to declarations of alcohol poisonings
        as causes of death in West Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, the most relevant features of the dataset we have
        analyzed are the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>LocationDesc</span>: String entries of the state wherein the ARDI was documented</li>
        <li><span>AgeGroup</span>: String entries of whether the individuals documented were
                of age ranges: 0-19, 20-34, 35-49, 50-64, and 65+</li>
        <li><span>Fatalities</span>: Integer entries of total fatality counts on a given documented incident combination</li>
        <li><span>Cause_of_Death</span>: String entries of declared cause of death</li>
        <li><span>Sex</span>: Sex as listed on Death Certificate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Lastly, our geographic analyses were mapped alongside state population data
        from <a href="https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/tree/master">Natural Earth Vector</a>,
        a public domain map, allowing for more accurate state-by-state <i>per capita</i> comparisons
        across <span>GeoPandas</span> plot analyses.

<h2 id="ov">National Overview of ARDIs</h2>
    <p>
        The Alcohol-Related Disease Impact application, or ARDI, estimates the number of
        deaths and years of potential life lost due to alcohol consumption. They help inform
        policy and response for public health agencies and researchers regarding the impact of
        alcohol on population health. To do this, the ARDI method analyzes mortality data and
        alcohol consumption patterns to calculate the proportion of deaths attributable
        to alcohol-related causes, with factors such as age, sex, alcohol use, and more<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Across all fifty states, the alcohol-related causes of death leading to the highest
        rates of fatality are: (1) alcoholic liver disease, (2) poisoning, not alcohol, (3)
        motor vehicle traffic crashes, (4) hypertension, (5) suicide, (6) liver cirrhosis, and
        (7) homicide (Fig 3). While rates of fatality nationwide drop sharply following the highest
        seven, the diverse range of health issues leading to death displayed here give insight
        into the multifaceted nature of alcohol-related harm. Particularly, not only may
        excessive alcohol most likely lead to liver damage, it also relates to impaired
        judgments in ingestion, causing poisoning, as well as impaired cognitive and motor
        functions, causing accidents.
    </p>

    <p>
        With this foundational understanding of nationwide alcohol health issues, we find
        increased nuances surrounding the complex landscape of public health response when we
        break down the causes of death per state. We find geographic variations in alcohol-related
        mortality patterns (Fig 4). For instance, states like Massachusetts with better healthcare infrastructure
        and access to preventative services would have overall lower rates of alcohol-related mortality
        due to early intervention and treatment. In addition, the availability of transportation
        and walking infrastructure minimize the risk of alcohol-based motor vehicle crashes. This
        comparison is very evident when compared to states like Florida and Texas.
    </p>

<h2 id="cs">Case Study: Age</h2>
    <p>
        As an area of further analysis, we delved into age-specific patterns of alcohol-related
        fatalities across different states. In doing so, we can uncover nuanced dynamics of
        alcohol-related harm and better inform targeted interventions at a local level to address
        age-specific vulnerabilities in mitigating alcohol-related mortality risks.
    </p>
    <iframe src="viz/age_map.html" width="100%" height="375px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>
        In the geospatial choropleth map, we can compare alcohol-related deaths of
        various age groups across the different states (Fig 5). For instance, we see that Louisiana particularly
        exhibits the highest alcohol-related deaths among individuals aged 0-19.
        This provides insight into how Louisiana may need to explore and address concerning trends in
        socioeconomic disparities, accessibility to alcohol, and cultural norms surrounding alcohol consumption
        (such as Mardi Gras) and how they lead to prevailing risk-taking behaviors among adolescents.
        On the other hand, states like New Hampshire demonstrate among the lowest rates of
        alcohol-related deaths, especially for adolescents, which may reflect more supportive
        communities for youth and overall stronger prevention efforts against alcoholism.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other spectrum, for ages 65 and above, states like Oregon, Vermont, Maine, and Florida
        depict particularly elevated rates of alcohol-related deaths for that age group, noting limited
        supportive services and concerning cultural attitudes among aging populations. Notably, Utah
        is a clear outlier in this range, with especially low rates of alcohol-related deaths among
        the elderly. Given the state's stringent alcohol policies, they inevitably form community
        support systems that promote a healthy aging population.
    </p>
    <iframe src="viz/age_heatmap.html" width="100%" height="450px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>
        For a more comprehensive overview of net fatality rates across all age groups, the heatmap
        relays insights into distinct regional patterns we could not observe in the geospatial
        choropleth map (Fig 6). When fully compared, we see how states like California, Florida, and
        Texas consistently exhibit highest net fatalities, reflective of the states' larger population
        sizes and urbanization likely leading to greater accessibility to alcohol, more complex
        socioeconomic disparities, and more limited healthcare access and enforcement of alcohol-related
        policies simply due to the population.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, in focusing on an age-specific case study, we are able to compare the fatalities and
        their regional variances, emphasizing once more the multifaceted nature of alcohol-related harm
        and the importance of locally directed public health strategies and community-based interventions
        in mitigating alcohol-related morbidity.
    </p>

    <iframe src="viz/donut.html" width="100%" height="450px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>
        It is evident that there is a gender gap between the sexes in Alcohol Mortality Rates. Despite Women being the
        Majority of the US population, men have an almost 2:1 mortality rate across almost every state. While the reason
        behind this phenomena cannot be claimed based on this data alone, there are some potential hypothesis.
        Primarily, men are promoted hard liquor such as wiskey and bourbon. Whereas cocktails are often seen as more
        feminine. Direct alcohol content may contribute to some increased acute moralities. However, this rationale
        cannot be justified on this dataset alone are require further investigation.
    </p>

<h2 id="co">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In having uncovered in-depth the geographic nuances and disparities nationwide on alcohol-attributable
        deaths, we can fully understand the comprehensive view into how variable the causes of death state-by-state
        simply due to the aforementioned spectra of specialized regional vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <iframe src="viz/death_map.html" width="100%" height="490px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>
        Going around different causes of death on the geospatial chloropeth map reveal further the extent of
        regional disparities (Fig 7). The western half of the United States show higher prevalences of alcoholic
        liver disease and suicide, whereas the eastern half conversely highlight coronary heart disease and
        laryngeal cancer. Florida becomes an outlier for ischemic stroke fatalities, given the combination of
        large urban centers and challenges in healthcare access. Southern states like Louisiana, Mississipi,
        and Alabama have a high concentration of homicide fatalities, attributable to cultural influences in
        crime rates and access to firearms.
    </p>
    <iframe src="viz/death_heatmap.html" width="100%" height="460px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p>
        Finally, the comprehensive heatmap concludes our understanding of alcohol-related mortality patterns
        nationwide (Fig 8). We see alcoholic liver disease as the most significant burden across multiple
        states, emphasizing the pervasive impact of chronic alcohol abuse on liver health. To a lesser, yet
        still notable, extent, we see again suicide, homicide, hypertension, liver cirrhosis,
        motor vehicle traffic crashes, and poisoning across all fifty states, emphasizing once more the
        multifaceted nature of alcohol-related mortality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Addressing such a myriad of underlying factors requires locally comprehensive public health
        interventions targeting substance abuse, mental health support, violence prevention, and
        even road safety measures. As a nation and in our own communities, we can prioritize
        evidence-based interventions, fostering cross-sector collaboration, and promoting public
        awareness and education to reduce the national burden of alcohol-related harm. In increasing
        health equity and preventing substance abuse, we can altogether create environments that
        support health behaviors and well-being for all.
